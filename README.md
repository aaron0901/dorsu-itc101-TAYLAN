Why Java is one of the go to languages nowadays?

The aspect which makes Java one of the most appealing languages is that it, at its core, Java is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language. OOP offers a neat modular structure, thereby making it easier to solve complex problems. Its modular nature helps programmers to write reusable code and also enhances the development process.

In Java programming, classes that define the data attributes and behaviors (defined by methods coded in the class) are used to create objects. Furthermore, Java includes features like abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance, along with best practices and built-in packages, simplifying the writing of Java code. Since Java Java objects donâ€™t need any external references, Java code is exceptionally robust.
